Simple Pong (aka Pong2k++ v0.0.1)
===========================================================================

Rudimentary version of the old Pong game.

Installing (on Linux)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) extract the source code

	tar xzvf spong-0.0.1.tar.gz

2) compile the game

	cd spong-0.0.1
	make

3) run the game

	./spong


Playing
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Left player: "a" moves paddle up, "z" moves paddle down
Right player: "up arrow" moves paddle up, "down arrow" moves paddle down

"p" pauses game
"q" quits game

The up/down arrows navigate the menus.  The first to six points wins and
the game starts over.


Troubleshooting
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
When initializing the SDL video mode, I've got HWSURFACE and DOUBLEBUF
enabled.  If you're having problems, you could try SWSURFACE instead.


Porting
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
SDL is supposed to work on other platforms, but I don't have access to
any, so if you really want to run this on something other than Linux,
you'll have to port it your self.  I'll gladly incorporate any changes
to make it portable if you donate them.
